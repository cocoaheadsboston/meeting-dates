This is a Ruby script that generates the next twelve CocoaHeads Boston meeting dates, based on the rule that our meetings are always the second Thursday of the month from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. I think it will be useful when composing room reservation request emails.

It requires the "ice_cube" Ruby gem.
